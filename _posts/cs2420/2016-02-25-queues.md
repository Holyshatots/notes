# Stacks

Stack is FILO (First in Last out)

Infix notation examples : 1 + 2 * 3 = ?

 - Hard to calculate easily

Postfix notation: 1 2 3 * +

  - 2 * 3 is evaluated first, then the result then added to 1
  - Also called reverse polish notation

Doing calculations with postfix notation:

  - When an operand is seen, push onto stack
  - When an operator is seen, pop twice, apply operator, push result
  - When the expression is done, pop (this is the final result)
  
# Queue

Queue is FIFO

Can implement using a linkedlist or an array that uses wraparound.

O(1) for all operations.


# Priority Queues

Special version of queue where items are returned with the highest level of  priority

Implementation: Arraylist with wraparound. Use binary search to insert in order. Dequeue will take the first.
LinkedList insertion search to find index to insert at.
