From coursera's Functional Programming Principles in Scala. Many of these notes
have information straight from the lecture slides.

## 1.1

_Paradigm_ : In science, a paradigm describes distinct concepts or though patterns in some scientific discipline:

Main programming paradigms:
- imperative
- functional
- logic

Imperative Programming:
- Modifying mutable variables
- using assignments
- and control structures such as if-then-else, loops, break, continue, return

Can be understood as instruction sequences for a Von Neumann computer

### What is a Theory?

A theory consists of
- Data types
- Operations on these data types
- Laws the describe the relationship between values and Operations

### Functional Programming

- In a _restricted sense_, function programming (FP) means programming without
mutable variables, assignments, loops, and other imperative control structures.
- In a _wider sense_, function programming means focusing on the Functions
