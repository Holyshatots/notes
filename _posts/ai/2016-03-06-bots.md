  - Machine translation: Translation from one human language to another
  - Named entity recognition (NER): Determine which items are proper names.

  - Parsing: Determing the analysis that is used for a sentence. Basically uses the rules of grammar where possible.

### Sentiment Analysis

Determining the attitude towards a topic.

Subjectivity/objectivity identification: Determining if a given text is objective or subjective. 

Feature/aspect-based sentiment analysis: Determining the sentiment on a specific entity/feature

#### Methods and Features

Knowledge-based techniques: "classify text by affect categories based on the presence of unambiguous affect words such as happy, sad, afraid, and bored." (Wikipedia)

Statistical methods: "leverage on elements from machine learning such as latenet semantic analysis, support vector machines,
"bag of words", and Semantic Orientation

There are hybrid approaches that use knowledge-based techniques and then using deep learning on the results from the 
knowledge-based techniques.
