Notes from the essays of [Breaking Smart](http://breakingsmart.com).


## A New Soft Technology

- "Software is eating the world."
- Only writing, money, and software are the only major soft technologies
invented
- Economic numbers only hint at the impact that software has. This is because
  the barrier to entry is small enough that people can start younger and
  before they enter the workforce.
- The Internet of Things would allow software to be a part of everything
- "To generations of Americans, owning a car represented freedom. To the next
  generation, _not_ owning a car will represent freedom."
- Many have underestimated the impact and they are suffering for it


#### Summary:

Software has begun taking over everything very quickly because of it's
flexibility and low entry cost.


## Getting Reoriented

- "There are four major reasons we underestimate the increasing power of
  software."
  1. Technology increases exponentially. Because of this we tend to want too
    much from technology in the short run but underestimate it's effects
    in the short run.
  2. We are past the "installation" phase of software, building the
    infrastructure, and are now on the deployment phase focused on the
    applications of the software.
  3. The impact that software has is not obvious because it has lead to
    innovations in other industries that were only possible because of
    software.
  4. The software revolution is being led by the young and not the old.
    The young are able to organize to create wealth independent of the
    strong institutions in place. This generation is less visible but also is
    more commercial in nature as opposed to ideological.

  "What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do
  during the week in ten years." - Chris Dixon

- The political consequences of this transformation are changing the typical
  _industrial script_ of childhood, school, college, work, and promotions
  based solely on seniority. Instead it is based off of the hacker ethos.
- The agrarian provincialism that the industrial script replaced was a
  significant advance.
- The uprising of the hacker movement can be related to the legend of
  Prometheus. The computer began at traditional and large corporations
  but has been unleashed with an open internet and startups.
- The decision to follow this new revolution is difficult because it involves
  throwing away an investment in the existing structure.
- This decision is called _breaking smart_.
- The future depends on how many people _break smart_.

#### Summary:

  The impact that software has is not obvious because it drives innovations
in other industries that would not be possible without software. The software
revolution is being led by the young and is challenging the existing
industrial order.
