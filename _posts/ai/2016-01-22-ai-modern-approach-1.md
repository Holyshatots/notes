# Chapter 1 : Introduction

Two main definitions of AI:
  - System that think like humans
  - Systems that think rationally

Also a split between if the agent has to think like or just act like.

__Turing Test__: must be indistinguishable from a human in a conversation.

To pass it would have to have :
  - natural language processing
  - knowledge representation
  - automated reasoning
  - machine learning

__Total Turing Test__: there is a video feed and a hatch to pass objects through in addition to the normal turing test.

AI shouldn't necessarily be about finding intelligence like ours :

"Aeronautical textbooks don't define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons."

__Cognitive science__: "Brings together computer moels from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to try to construct precise and testable theories of the workings of the human mind."

__logicist__: Tradition in AI to use the notation of logicians to build intelligent systems.

2 main obstacles to logicist approach :
  - Hard to take informal knowledge and apply it to format notation especially when not 100% certain
  - Too computationally expensive to be reasonable

__rational agent__: "Something that acts to achieve the best outcome, or thwne there is some uncertainty, the best expected outcome."

This book is "concentrated on general principles of rational agents and on components for constructing them."

__materialism__: "Holds that the brain's operation according to the laws of physics constitutes the mind."

__induction__: "that general rules are acquired by exposure to repeated associations between their elements"

Godel created __incompleteness theorem__: "showed that in any language expressive enough to describe the properties of the natural numbers there are true statements that are undecidable in the sense that their truth cannot be established by any algorithm."

"Shows that there are some functions on the integers that cannot be represented by an algorithm."

__Church-Turing thesis__: "states that the Turing machine is capable of computing any computable function, is generally accepted as providing a sufficient definition."

 - Also showed that there are some functions that no Turing machine can compute.

__NP-complete__: problems that are most likely intractable (has not been proven).

__Bayesian analysis__: updating the probabilities in the light of new evidence

__Decision theory__: combines probability theory with utility theory
