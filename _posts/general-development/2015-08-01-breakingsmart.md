Notes from the essays of [Breaking Smart](http://breakingsmart.com).


## A New Soft Technology

- "Software is eating the world."
- Only writing, money, and software are the only major soft technologies
invented
- Economic numbers only hint at the impact that software has. This is because
  the barrier to entry is small enough that people can start younger and
  before they enter the workforce.
- The Internet of Things would allow software to be a part of everything
- "To generations of Americans, owning a car represented freedom. To the next
  generation, _not_ owning a car will represent freedom."
- Many have underestimated the impact and they are suffering for it


#### Summary:

Software has begun taking over everything very quickly because of it's
flexibility and low entry cost.


## Getting Reoriented

- "There are four major reasons we underestimate the increasing power of
  software."
  1. Technology increases exponentially. Because of this we tend to want too
    much from technology in the short run but underestimate it's effects
    in the short run.
  2. We are past the "installation" phase of software, building the
    infrastructure, and are now on the deployment phase focused on the
    applications of the software.
  3. The impact that software has is not obvious because it has lead to
    innovations in other industries that were only possible because of
    software.
  4. The software revolution is being led by the young and not the old.
    The young are able to organize to create wealth independent of the
    strong institutions in place. This generation is less visible but also is
    more commercial in nature as opposed to ideological.

  "What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do
  during the week in ten years." - Chris Dixon

- The political consequences of this transformation are changing the typical
  _industrial script_ of childhood, school, college, work, and promotions
  based solely on seniority. Instead it is based off of the hacker ethos.
- The agrarian provincialism that the industrial script replaced was a
  significant advance.
- The uprising of the hacker movement can be related to the legend of
  Prometheus. The computer began at traditional and large corporations
  but has been unleashed with an open internet and startups.
- The decision to follow this new revolution is difficult because it involves
  throwing away an investment in the existing structure.
- This decision is called _breaking smart_.
- The future depends on how many people _break smart_.

#### Summary:

  The impact that software has is not obvious because it drives innovations
in other industries that would not be possible without software. The software
revolution is being led by the young and is challenging the existing
industrial order.

## Towards a Mass Flourishing

Four characteristics of how the future will emerge:

1. Silicon Valley is the heart of this cultural change
2. Small groups will have large impacts. Small being a group able to be
  fed by two pizzas.
3. The progress will be gradual and uneven but the trend will generally be
  upwards.
4. "Rapid declines in the costs of solutions to problems"

- The hacker ethos will spread and the state of the economy will be challenged.
- Work will be more fluid than the standard paycheck of today

#### Summary:

Small groups with the Silicon Valley culture will produce large impacts across
the world to change the way we currently work.

## Purists versus Pragmatists

- Purists need everything to be the same
- Pragmatists are only focused on functionality

## Agility and Illegibility

_Authoritarian high modernism_ : a purist architectural aesthetic driven by the authoritarian priorities.

Authoritarianism in software development has created rigid manufacturing like rules
that have killed the original tinkering hacker mentality.

The agile philosophy in software creates "illegible, collective patterns of creativity,
weaken illusions of control, and resist being yoked to driving utopian vision".

There is a movement to free information in things like:
- Open Geographic Information System (GIS)
- open data in government
- Monitoring technologies in agriculture

Once a field has increased information availability it makes it hacker-friendly which
leads to it being eaten by software.

## Rough Consensus and Maximal Interestingness

- "Software programming is labor that _creates_ capital"
