## Part 1 : Why not to do a startup

Good things about a startup:

- Opportunity to be in control of your own destiny
- Opportunity to create something new
- Opportunity to have an impact on the world
- Create an ideal culture and work with a dream team of people
- $$$

Bad things about a startup:

- Emotional rollercoaster
- Uncertainty and risk
- Nothing happens unless I make it happen
- Get told no a lot
- Hiring is painful
- Going to have to eventually hire executives
- Long hours
- Potential for startup culture to go bad

## Part 2 : When the VCs say "no"

If told no by multiple VCs there may be something wrong with your plan.
To mitigate this do the following:

1. Lay the groundwork to go back in later : Come back with a new set of facts when told no
2. Consider the environment : Understand the current funding environment
3. Retool your plan


### Layers of risk for a startup

- Founder risk
- Market risk
- Competition risk
- Timing risk
- Financing risk
- Marketing risk 
- Distribution risk 
- Technology risk
- Product risk
- Hiring risk
- Location risk

### Reducing risk

- Founder risk : Seriously consider the founders and if they will be able to run with business or build the product
- Market risk : Validate the market to make sure that there will be buyers
- Competition risk : Is the startup differentiated enough from potential or current competition
- Timing risk : Make progress and make sure it is on time for the market
- Financing risk : Carefully manage your money and decide where it will be best spent
- Distribution risk : If the product is dependent on a distribution partner, get the deal before raising money
- Technology risk : Make the product and then raise money
- Hiring risk : Find out the complaints that the VC has and solve them
- Location risk : If there isn't a lot of money in startups around you may need to move where there is (like Silicon Valley)

To raise the initial money needed to build the product / food and shelter you while building the product consider :

- Raise angel money
- Bootstrap off of initial customers
- Consulting contracts
- Work on it after hours with a job
- Quit the job and live off of credit cards (This one isn't as great of an idea)

The most important thing is to get the product built and then getting customers for the product.

## Part 3 : "But I don't know any VCs!"

Most VCs work through referrals and don't have time for the majority of startups that would like to meet with him or her.

The best thing to do when meeting with a VC is to walk in with a working product.

The next thing is to have a fleshed out presentation with mockups, screenshots, market analyses, customer research, etc.

The best way to develop contacts with VCs is to work at a venture-backed startup and make an impact while networking the entire time.

- Use Y combinator
- Read VC blogs

- Create or contribute to a meaningful opensource project
